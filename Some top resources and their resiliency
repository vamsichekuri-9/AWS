Explanation of Categories:

Global Resilient: These services are designed to be globally available and resilient, not tied to any specific region. They provide capabilities that span across AWS's global infrastructure.

Region Resilient: These services operate within a specific region but are designed to handle failures within that region through various configurations. They are resilient to issues in a single AZ by utilizing multiple AZs within the region or through specific regional features.

Availability Zone Resilient: These services are dependent on a specific AZ within a region. If the AZ experiences issues, these services or instances may become unavailable unless configured with redundancy or failover to other AZs.
