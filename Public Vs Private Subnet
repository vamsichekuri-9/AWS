Public Subnet:
Definition: A public subnet in AWS is one that has a route to the internet via an internet gateway. This allows instances within the subnet to be directly reachable from the internet, provided they are assigned a public IP address or an Elastic IP.

Use Case: You typically place EC2 instances in a public subnet if they need to serve traffic directly from the internet, such as web servers, proxy servers, or any servers that need direct inbound connectivity.



Private Subnet:
Definition: A private subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway and therefore, cannot directly send or receive traffic to and from the internet. Instances in a private subnet can access the internet using NAT (Network Address Translation) gateways or instances that route the traffic, ensuring the instances themselves are not directly exposed to the internet.

Use Case: EC2 instances in private subnets are typically used for backend processes that should not be directly accessible from the internet. This includes application servers, databases, and internal service servers.
